# Technical test 6 created by Iris Paredes.

# Description and specifications.
We will make a simple task list application with a basic functionality:
1. Complete a task.
2. Uncheck a completed task.
3. Add a new task.

# Specifications:

The exercise will be done in JS without the help of external frameworks or libraries.
The main priority is that the tasks or actions requested can be completed.
The next priority, once the main one is resolved, is to get as close as possible to the graphic guides offered.
The list of tasks must be stored in the browser's Local Storage, so that if we reload the page we do not lose the information
The current date must appear;)
Everything develops on the same page, there is only 1.


# Tasks:
Complete a task: Click on a task, or checkbox, mark the task as completed and place it at the end of the list.

Unmark a completed task: Click on a completed task, or checkbox, mark the task as pending and place it at the top of the list.

Add a new task: it shows a layer where we can fill in the name of the task and add it. It will appear first.
